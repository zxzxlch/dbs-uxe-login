# DBS UXE Assignment

This is a simple login screen prototype built with Angular.

The login form uses `FormFieldComponent`, which wraps a label, input element and a `FormFieldErrorComponent`. It also enhances accessibility by adding ids and attributes to its components.

The form performs validation on submission. It'll show errors for invalid fields and failed authentication.

Try out the deployed app on [https://dbs-uxe-login.vercel.app](https://dbs-uxe-login.vercel.app). The login credentials are: 

Username: `odo`\
Password: `cookie`

## Set Up

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

- Make sure you have Angular installed.

- Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

- Execute `npm start` to launch the application. It will be accessible at http://localhost:4200/.
